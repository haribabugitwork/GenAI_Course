I would like to develop a GenAI project to create a summary pdf file from the inpput pdf file using GEMINI_API key with gemini-flash-2.0 model with proper prompt. I also expect to have an endpoint using FastAPI. I would like to set up all this using uv init and uv add commands, provide the plan and command, source code and then provide a streamlit interface to test this by uploading a pdf file and using the end point created. I want this streamlit interface code in a seperate folder as client which also shall be set up using uv commands
